# Chenzo's Hello World React.JS app

*I'm not entirely sure I like reactjs*


Really. I don't know if I like that my HTML is in the JS. Doesn't google want it's content on the page BEFORE JS runs? Also, I'm getting weird compilation errors. 

```bundle.js:1 Warning: It looks like you're using a minified copy of the development build of React. When deploying React apps to production, make sure to use the production build which skips development warnings and is faster. See https://fb.me/react-minification for more details.```

What? What does that mean? 

This project was created via this tutorial https://www.codementor.io/reactjs/tutorial/beginner-guide-setup-reactjs-environment-npm-babel-6-webpack - but I think it's dated (even at like 3 months. ungh.)
